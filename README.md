Khichdi is a functional language which supports:
- Mutable variables (by-reference and by-value)
- Mutable boxes
- First-class (recursive) functions
- Arrays, dictionaries and pairs
- Backstops (more on this later)
- Generalized search
- Exceptions
- Continuations

Khichdi is my attempt of putting together most of the ideas I learned in CPSC 311: Definition of Programming Languages (hence the name).
